/**
 * The options representing the blocking behavior of many admin operations.
 *
 * Said operations are typically require polling to determine completion. They may or may not be
 * extremely long-running, depending on the operation, but they are not instantaneous.
 *
 * The default behavior is to block until the operation is complete, with a `pollInterval` determined on a
 * method-by-method basis, but able to be overridden.
 *
 * Otherwise, it can be made "non-blocking" by setting `blocking` to `false`, where it's up to the caller
 * to determine when the operation is complete.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Will block by default until the operation is complete.
 * const dbAdmin1 = await admin.createDatabase({...});
 *
 * // Will not block until the operation is complete.
 * // Still returned an AstraDbAdmin object, but it's not very useful
 * // until the operation completes.
 * const dbAdmin2 = await admin.createDatabase({...}, {
 *   blocking: false,
 * });
 *
 * // Blocks with a custom poll interval (per 5s).
 * const dbAdmin3 = await admin.createDatabase({...}, {
 *   blocking: true,
 *   pollInterval: 5000,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * By "blocking", we mean that the operation will not return until the operation is complete, which is
 * determined by polling the operation at a regular interval. "Non-blocking" means that the operation
 * makes the initial request, but then returns immediately, leaving it up to the caller to determine
 * when the operation is complete.
 *
 * If it's chosen not to block, keep in mind that the objects that the operation returns may not be
 * fully usable, or even usable at all, until the operation is complete. createDatabase, for example,
 * returns an AstraDbAdmin object, but there's no initialized database for it to work on until the
 * database is fully created.
 *
 * @field blocking - Whether to block the operation until it is complete.
 * @field pollInterval - The interval at which to poll the operation for completion.

     *
     * The key may use dot-notation to access nested fields, such as `'field'`, `'field.subfield'`, `'field.3'`,
     * `'field.3.subfield'`, etc. If lists are encountered and no numeric index is specified, all items in the list are

     * cast the return type to the correct one.
     *
     * Distinct works with arbitrary objects as well, by creating a deterministic hash of the object and comparing it

     *
     * For details on the behaviour of "distinct" in conjunction with real-time changes in the collection contents, see

     *
     * **Note: prefer not to use this method; its implementation is subject to change on short notice.**
     *
     * Each operation is treated as a separate, unrelated request to the server; it is not performed in a transaction.
     *
     * You can set the `ordered` option to `true` to stop the operations after the first error, otherwise all operations

     * If an operational error occurs, the operation will throw a {@link BulkWriteError} containing the partial result.
